# Blackjack-game
I coded this program of the popular casino game Blackjack in Python language using concepts of Object oriented programming (OOPS) and Exception handling


Game Play
To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

Create a deck of 52 cards
Shuffle the deck
Ask the Player for their bet
Deal one card to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
In case the sum is 21 (BLACKJACK) the bet will be increased by 2.5 times 
Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
Show their total winnings and profit/loss
