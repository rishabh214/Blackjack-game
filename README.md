To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:<br>
1.Create a deck of 52 cards<br>
2.Shuffle the deck<br>
3.Ask the Player for their bet<br>
4.Deal one card to the Dealer and two cards to the Player<br>
5.Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card<br>
6.If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.<br>
7.If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17<br>
8.Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly<br>
9.In case the sum is 21 (BLACKJACK) the bet will be increased by 2.5 times <br>
